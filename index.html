            <p>You step into the fabled Lost Woods, apprehensive of what you'll find. The name suits the place well. No one you know has ever come out of the woods after having entered. In fact, you know of two people in particular that entered and never came out. Is that to be your fate as well? Looking around it doesn't seem so bad. There are four exits including the way you came in from the south.</p>
